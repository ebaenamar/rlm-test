    Review 1 (5/5): "Absolutely love this laptop! The battery lasts all day and it's super fast. 
    Perfect for my programming work. The screen is gorgeous and the keyboard feels great."
    
    Review 2 (3/5): "It's okay. Good performance but I think it's overpriced for what you get. 
    The trackpad is a bit finicky and the fans get loud under load."
    
    Review 3 (5/5): "Best laptop I've ever owned. Handles video editing like a champ. 
    The build quality is excellent and it looks professional."
    
    Review 4 (2/5): "Disappointed. The screen has backlight bleed and it runs very hot. 
    Customer service was unhelpful when I tried to return it."
    
    Review 5 (4/5): "Great value for the price. Does everything I need for work and school. 
    Battery life is good but not amazing. Would recommend."
    
    Review 6 (2/5): "Build quality feels cheap despite the high price. 
    The hinge is already loose after 2 months. Not worth it."
    
    Review 7 (5/5): "Perfect for developers and designers. Fast, reliable, and beautiful. 
    The retina display is stunning for photo editing."
    
    Review 8 (3/5): "Decent laptop but battery drains faster than advertised. 
    Performance is good though. Wish it had more ports."
    
    Review 9 (5/5): "Exceeded my expectations! Lightweight, powerful, and the battery really does last all day. 
    Great for travel and remote work."
    
    Review 10 (1/5): "Terrible experience. Arrived with a dead pixel and the SSD failed after one week. 
    Avoid this product."
